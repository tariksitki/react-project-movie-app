In this repository I have designed a project named "Movie-App" 
with React , Bootstrap, React Router, Axios, Firebase.

In this project;

• Users could register with their email address and password. Or they could sign in with your Google account.
• By clicking on each film, they could get detailed information about that film and watch a YouTube video of that film.
• According to the keyword entered by the user, movie data is extracted from TMDB (The Movie Database) and displayed to the user.


Thank you so much ...
